No we learn how to ignore file to store on git hub.

for that purpose we create a file with the name   .gitignore.txt

This fill Will uploaded by using commands ok

sorry i add this file just for sample or practice.

we have already this file in out project .gitignore under the test folder in our project.
so we open it
this have some by default that are already added in it because
when we run project some files are in out pc so this make issue and storage waste
so add these file in .gitignore file.

now we will create a folder with name      man      and
we add this folder name in to .gitignore file
 now we will the commands to upload it.
